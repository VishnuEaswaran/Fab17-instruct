Quintessence

This week we will learn about Microcontrollers, Processors and how to write program to operate them. The focus is on understanding the **hardware** and **software** related to controllers. You will learn programming using boards designed and manufactured in the electronic design week. One important learning outcome is learning how to interpret **Datasheet** of a device/components and to understand its importance.

Lets split this week into three

 * Hardware
