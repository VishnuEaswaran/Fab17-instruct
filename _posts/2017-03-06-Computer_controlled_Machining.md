Quintessence
===
This week we are going to make something [BIG](http://blog.ted.com/2008/07/15/digitally_fabbe/) using the CNC machine/s and of course document all that. The large format machine in our lab is [ShopBot](http://www.shopbottools.com/mProducts/prSalpha.htm). The Modella MDX 20 we used for milling PCB's is not just for that but also for milling many other materials.

Details
===

This weeks objectives are

+  Design a (physically)big object which can be made using the available CNC machine.
  - Design in 2D and 3D for milling
  - Design Rules

    * Dependency on material
    * Machine specific Dependencies
    * etc


+ Machining what you have designed

  - Details about ShopBot

    * bed size
    * degrees of freedom
    * about bits
    * spindle
    * x, y & z motion
    * etc

  - The software part

    * positioning the spindle/bit and setting the origin
    * Zeroing process
    * etc

Safety First
===

- Wear goggles when going near working machines
- Wear safety gloves if needed
- If you have long hair, tie it up properly so that it wont get in the way of a moving parts.

Common errors
===

This is gonna be a very long list as there are many trivial, typical and frequent mistakes which could lead to catastrophic results or stuff for good stories.
