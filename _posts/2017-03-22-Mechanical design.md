### This weeks [assessment sheet](http://docs.academany.org/FabAcademy-Assessment/_book/mechanical_design,_machine_design.html)

Quintessence
===

This week marks the beginning of the *machine* making. We will start by learning about different aspects of mechanical designing. All the fundamentals elements of mechanical structures are brought int discussion in this weeks [page](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/mechanical_design/index.html) - starting from principles to reliable vendors for the parts. Neil also mentions the **Fab Lab 2.0** concept along with 2 successful approaches present now.

We will structure the content in accordance with Neil's order and thus have a relatable reference.

Into the Details
===

If you have followed Neils Lecture and if you remember the physics from high school you have covered almost 3/4th of fundamentals. The rest can be learned by doing rather than reading. You might have come across many projects for making *CNC plotters, robotic arms, CNC milling machines, 3D printers etc*. Also go through previous years machine building assignments from the class archives. Following are a list of interesting replicable projects.
