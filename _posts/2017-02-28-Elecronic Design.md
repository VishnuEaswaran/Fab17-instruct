title: Electronic Design
---

This week we will learn to design PCB's and in the process about the components/building blocks of electronics. We can separate the week into two

  1. Electronic components

  2. Circuit Design

Take a note that you have got interesting books in your lab itself. `The art of electronics` by `Horowitz and Hill` which is the BIBLE of electronics and circuit-design so please spend sometime "offline" and get a feel of the book. All the topics listed below can be found there except the specifics of design softwares.

## Basic about Electronic components

  * Electrical fundamentals  - voltage, current and their relation.
  * Active components
  * Passive components

## Basic about Microcontrollers

  * What is a controller and what differentiate it from a processor ?
  * The microcontroller families in your lab - AVR and PIC(rarely)
  * Architecture and different parts of a controller

    * Details on Registers, memory, fuses, clock etc.
    * What is meant by digital in electronics and an intro to how it is implemented for computation.

## Circuit-Design

  * Intro to popular softwares

      * [Eagle](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)
      * [Protius](https://www.labcenter.com/)
      * [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/)
      * [123DCircuits](http://www.123dapp.com/circuits)
      * [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/)
      * [Altium](http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview)
      * [OrCAD](http://www.orcad.com/)

    More are available in this weeks page, try as many as possible and share your views and choose one for the rest of the academy.

  * Design rules

    * Related to traces
    * Related to pads, vias and distance between adjacent ones.
    * Identifying the package size and designing accordingly


  * Designing custom library/part.

  Some nice examples:
